# Boon
Boon is a web application that helps universities manage everything involved with community service. With Boon, high schools and universities can easily publish community service activities for students to sign up, track the hours completed by students, register attendence on-site, and more. Students can view all the available activities that their school offers in one place, sign up, and track their community service hours completed. 

Boon is the first startup I founded. I started the company after experiencing many problems completing the required community service hours to graduate from high school.
