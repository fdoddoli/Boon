# Boon
Boon is an application that helps universities manage everything involved with community service.

Boon is the first startup I founded. I started the company after experiencing many problems completing the required community service hours to graduate from high school. 
With Boon, high schools and universities can easily publish community service activities for students to sign up, track the hours completed by students, register attendence on-site, and more.
